## DUMA
### Detect Unintended Memory Access
#### A Red-Zone memory allocator

NOTE: Unaware of the [original author](https://github.com/hayguen/duma) doing similar work to convert
his legacy CVS repository to Git, completed with backdated, yet updated and
corrected commit and authorship attributions (github.com/hayguen/duma), I
completed much of same job with similar results. Perhaps my repo is a bit more
pedantic, especially tracking down and doing my best to properly commit patches
found on random forums, various other repositories, and mailing lists, but,
perhaps a bit more liberally, as I have also merged in my own changes to the
package as well.

Now, the big job is to reconcile these two very similar yet independently
reconstructed repositories, and decide which should will be "the winner".

Regardless of the actual commits or patches chosen to stay and those that may
be dropped or need a bit more massaging, it's very likely I'll be primary
source repository and future home of the DUMA package.

Hayati Ayguen is no longer actively maintaining or working on it, and surely
doesn't want to deal with the continued burden of maintenance and support 
requests for the package, which began 'life' as a fork of Bruce Perens' 
ElectricFence (which he created at Pixar in 1987). DUMA had it's start a bit
later in 1993. So, now, more than 25 years later, Hayati's put his time in,
and can move on to new projects and hobbies, remaining an available resource.
